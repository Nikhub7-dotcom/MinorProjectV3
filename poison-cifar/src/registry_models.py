"""
Model registry. build_model(arch, num_classes, in_channels, image_size)
returns a ready-to-train nn.Module for any (dataset, architecture) pair
in the project's grid.

Two families of adaptation happen here, and only here:

1. ResNet family (10/18/50): the standard ImageNet stem (7x7 stride-2
   conv + maxpool) is replaced with a 3x3 stride-1 conv and no maxpool
   whenever image_size <= 64, exactly as done for the original CIFAR-10
   ResNet-18 in Phase 2.
2. VGG-19 / DenseNet-161: these assume much larger inputs and are
   harder to re-stem cleanly (VGG's 5 maxpools alone reduce a 32x32
   image to 1x1). Small inputs are upsampled to a minimum working
   resolution (64x64) internally instead — a pragmatic choice, not a
   claim that this is the optimal way to run these on tiny images.

There is no official "ResNet-10" — it's defined here the natural way
(BasicBlock, one block per stage, half of ResNet-18's depth).
